When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I gonna work in more than one computer or with another person.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because I want to control when the commits are good to show to others people. Only push them when it's working.
